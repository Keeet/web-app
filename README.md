# SE_20 alternative assessment

This app is deployed to https://app.keeet.io - you can just create a new account and you should be able to interact with the web-app (creating project, creating survey, ...). You can find more information about the product here: https://keeet.io/

Some additional information regarding my assessment: I talked about this with Adam briefly when applying for the module, but since he is not here, I hope we can find a way to still do the assessment. The reason why I would like to do it this semester is that, I can't start writing my Bachelor thesis next semester otherwise.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
